    <Heading title="What is a Simple Man's Summary?" />
    <p>
        "A Simple Man's Summary" is my version of "A dummy's guide to", and they
        are often summaries I write for myself. When someone approaches me with
        a complex topic I don't understand, I sit down with them and draft A
        Simple Man's Summary.
        <strong>Because I am, quite honestly, a simple man,</strong> and complex
        things don't sit well with me.
